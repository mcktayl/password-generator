# password-generator

## Description
My goal was to create a password generator that prompts the user to select a length between 8 and 128 characters and provides options for which characters to include.  This allows the user to randomly generate a password to fit their needs.  This project taught me how to use Math.random & Math.floor to my advantage, and how to set a variable for what criteria was included.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation
This project runs in the browser and requires no installation from user.

## Usage
The user clicks "Generate Password" and is then prompted to select a length.  If they do not select a valid length, it alerts them and prompts them again.  Once length is selected, user decides whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters in their password.  It then generates a password based on the criteria selected.
